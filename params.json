{"name":"Tribulations","tagline":"A Javascript library for Marionette that does away with boilerplate display logic of instructions and experimental tasks in remote experiments.","body":"Tribulations: The Online Experiment Runner\r\n============\r\n\r\nTribulations is a Javascript library for [Marionette](http://marionettejs.com/) that does away with boilerplate display logic of instructions and experimental tasks in remote experiments.\r\n\r\nThis library is designed and developed with researchers of human-computer interaction in mind.\r\n\r\nDemo and Documentation\r\n-----------\r\nSee the [demo](TODO) and [documentation](TODO).\r\n\r\nWhen should I use Tribulations?\r\n------------\r\nYou should use Tribulations when your **experimental structure can be expressed by a tree**. For example, consider evaluating the performance of multiple clicking tools ( *conditions* ). In each condition, there are multiple *blocks*, and in each block, there are multiple *trials*.\r\n\r\n![Example of a tree showing experimental structure](docs/experiment_structure.png)\r\n\r\nAside from the assumption that your experimental structure follows a tree with leaves at equal depth, **Tribulations makes no assumptions about the content of your experiment**. \r\n\r\nPrerequisites\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nTribulations uses Marionette, a popular Javascript MV\\* framework built on Backbone.js. \r\n\r\n* [Marionette.js](http://marionettejs.com)\r\n  * [jQuery](http://jquery.com)\r\n  * [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/)\r\n  * [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/)\r\n\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n-------------\r\nInstall [npm](https://npmjs.org/) and run `npm install`. To run the tests, install [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/).  \r\n\r\nTo compile and test, run `grunt`.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-32823730-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
